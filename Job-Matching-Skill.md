### Phase 3: Thorough Deep Dive (10+ min)

6. **Google advanced searches**:

    - Flag positions closing within 2 weeks

2. **Tier 2**: Strong fit (most criteria match OR top institution)
3. **Tier 3**: Potential fit (some criteria match, worth considering)

Within each tier, sort by application deadline (soonest first).

---

## Special Considerations

### Red Flags to Note
- Very low teaching load might indicate research-only (good!)
- Very high teaching load might limit research time (flag this)
- "Open rank" positions often prefer junior candidates (note if associate/full specifically mentioned)
- Positions requiring language proficiency (flag if not English)
- Positions requiring citizenship/work permits (note visa requirements)

### Green Flags to Highlight
- Endowed/named chairs (prestigious)
- New centers or initiatives (startup resources)
- Explicit behavioral economics/policy focus
- Interdisciplinary opportunities
- Strong PhD programs (access to research assistants)
- Research funding mentioned
- Light teaching loads (more research time)
- High salaries or strong benefits

### Pay Range Context (Europe)

**Typical Ranges by Country** (Associate/Full Professor):
- **UK**: £60K-90K (Associate), £80K-110K+ (Full), top schools higher
- **Switzerland**: CHF 150K-250K+ (very high, adjust for cost of living)
- **Germany**: €60K-85K (W2), €75K-110K+ (W3), plus negotiations
- **Netherlands**: €5K-7K/month (Associate), €6K-8.5K/month (Full)
- **France**: €40K-70K base, plus bonuses at top schools
- **Scandinavia**: €60K-90K (high taxes, excellent benefits)

Note if actual range is disclosed or if "competitive" is mentioned.

## Execution Checklist

When user requests job search, follow this checklist:

- [ ] Review current date and calculate "deadline not passed" cutoff
- [ ] Execute Phase 1: Broad search across all major job boards
- [ ] Execute Phase 2: Deep search of top 25 + field-specific institutions
- [ ] Execute Phase 3: Advanced searches and alternative sources
- [ ] Execute Phase 4: Verify all deadlines and filter out passed deadlines
- [ ] Compile results in specified format
- [ ] Prioritize into Tier 1/2/3
- [ ] Create summary statistics
- [ ] Review for any red/green flags
- [ ] Double-check all application links are working
- [ ] Provide final formatted output

---

## Example Usage

**User command**: "Find jobs for me" or "Search for academic positions" or "What jobs are available?"

**Your response**:
1. Acknowledge and start search
2. Work through all phases systematically
3. Provide comprehensive results in specified format
4. Offer to:
   - Deep dive on any specific position
   - Help tailor application materials
   - Set up alerts for future searches
   - Expand geographic scope if results are limited

---

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Email alert integration (if user wants weekly scans)
- Application tracking (which positions user applied to)
- Institution comparison tool (rank institutions by fit)
- Application material templates specific to European institutions
- Network analysis (which faculty at target institutions user might know)

---

## Important Notes

1. **Deadline sensitivity**: Academic job deadlines are hard. Flag anything < 2 weeks prominently.

2. **Application timing**: Many European positions post in fall (Sept-Nov) for next academic year. Spring postings are rarer but exist.

3. **Work permits**: Brexit changed UK hiring of EU citizens. Note visa requirements where evident.

4. **Language requirements**: Most top European schools use English, but some countries (France, Germany) may prefer local language for teaching. Always note if language requirement exists.

5. **Cultural differences**: European academic hiring is sometimes less formal than US. Personal connections matter significantly in some countries.

6. **Field fit**: Eugen's interdisciplinary background is an asset - don't filter too narrowly. A sociology department with behavioral focus could be perfect.

7. **Be comprehensive but honest**: If a position is borderline, include it in Tier 3 with caveats rather than excluding it.

---

## Quality Standards

Every search should:
- Cover all major job boards
- Check at least 20 institution websites directly
- Verify every deadline
- Provide working links
- Include honest assessment of fit
- Note any missing information (salary, deadline, etc.)
- Be formatted consistently
- Include summary statistics

Aim for finding 10-30 positions per search depending on time of year and market conditions.
